# impulse-physics-xna
An impulse-based physics engine for the MonoGame/XNA game framework.

The main project is under the directory "ImpulseEngine2". The other directories include testing clients that target specific areas of interest for testing and debugging.
This project was not made with the intent to be used for any serious games and just serves as an area of practice. This means that there will be no regard for upholding standards within the code, and everything is subject to change.

Some principles are based off of this tutorial by Randy Gaul: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-custom-2d-physics-engine-the-basics-and-impulse-resolution--gamedev-6331
However, all code is written from scratch with minimal reference to the tutorial beyond the basic ideas for collision detection and impulse generation.
